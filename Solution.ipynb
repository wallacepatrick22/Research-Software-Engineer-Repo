    "From my analysis of the code snippet, I made observations and will recommend as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Avoid nested loop where possible as this is a known factor that increases the execution time of a program due to the number of operations required. For example two loops repeated separately 100 times will produces 200 opeartions while two loops repeated 100 times  as a nested loops will produce 10,000 opearations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Avoid unnecessary repetition and redundancy in your code as s[j]=0 was repeated twice in your code with one of the assignment of the supposed list index  s[j] was not necessary and can be taken out of the code.\n",

    "3.) Range objects which is the returned value from a range function are immutable and cannot be reassigned a new value. Instead the range objects should be converted to a list if you wish to reassign values of the range objects.\n",
    "\n",
